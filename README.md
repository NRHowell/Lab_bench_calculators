# Lab_bench_calculators
A collection of Python modules and notebooks for biologists and general lab workers.

Modules and notebooks available:
 - Serial dilution calculator. Module - returns a dilution series in a standard assay plate formats. Requires the data file 'plate_data.toml'. 
 
 - EC anything calculator. Module - determines a range of EC values from a given EC50 and the Hill slope
 
 - Rad Calcs! - A Jupyter notebook to assist with calculating the decay, specific activity and concentration of radioactive solutions.
              - Takes halflife and isoptope data from https://radioactivedecay.github.io/
              

These are all personal projects I have started in order to learn more about coding and computing in general.
I'll continue to add tools I make, and that I find useful, as I complete them.

All feedback and suggestions are welcome. 

Thanks!
